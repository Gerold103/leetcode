// - t1 is a file contains table "t1" with two columns "a" and "x". First line is a number of rows, then each
//  line contains exactly one row, that contains two numbers parsable by Double.parse(): value for column a and
//  x respectively.See test resources for examples.
// - t2 is a file contains table "t2" with columns "b" and "y". Same format.
// - t3 is a file contains table "t3" with columns "c" and "z". Same format.
// - output is table stored in the same format: first line is a number of rows, then each line is one row that
//  contains two numbers: value for column a and s.
//
// Number of rows of all three tables lays in range [0, 1_000_000].
// It's guaranteed that full content of all three tables fits into RAM.
// It's guaranteed that full outer join of at least one pair (t1xt2 or t2xt3 or t1xt3) of tables can fit into RAM.
//
// TODO: Implement following query, put a reasonable effort into making it efficient from perspective of
//  computation time, memory usage and resource utilization (in that exact order). You are free to use any lib
//  from a maven central.
//
// SELECT a, SUM(X * y * z) AS s FROM 
// t1 LEFT JOIN (SELECT * FROM t2 JOIN t3) AS t
// ON a < b + c
// GROUP BY a
// STABLE ORDER BY s DESC
// LIMIT 10;
// 
// Note: STABLE is not a standard SQL command. It means that you should preserve the original order. 
// In this context it means, that in case of tie on s-value you should prefer value of a, with a lower row number.
// In case multiple occurrences, you may assume that group has a row number of the first occurrence.
